Description: Detect Differential Clustering of Genomic Sites such as
        gene therapy integrations.  The package provides some functions
        for exploring genomic insertion sites originating from two
        different sources. Possibly, the two sources are two different
        gene therapy vectors.  Vectors are preferred that target
        sensitive regions less frequently, motivating the search for
        localized clusters of insertions and comparison of the clusters
        formed by integration of different vectors.  Scan statistics
        allow the discovery of spatial differences in clustering and
        calculation of False Discovery Rates (FDRs) providing
        statistical methods for comparing retroviral vectors. A scan
        statistic for comparing two vectors using multiple window
        widths to detect clustering differentials and compute FDRs is
        implemented here.
